# Atlan Release Optimization

This project is designed to optimize the release process using Helm, Helmfile, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation with advanced rollback capabilities.

## Completed Enhancements
### ðŸ“Œ Optimized Helm Chart Deployment
âœ… Reduced Helm Chart Sync Time â€“ Refactored the Helm chart to be modular, improving deployment speed.
âœ… Parallelized Helm Processes â€“ Introduced parallel execution to prevent blocking engineers.
âœ… Helm Values Customization â€“ Used environment-based Helm values to reduce redundancy.

### ðŸ“Œ Automated CI/CD Pipeline with Advanced Rollback
âœ… GitHub Actions for CI/CD â€“ Set up an end-to-end pipeline for backend, frontend, and database.
âœ… Docker Build & Push â€“ Uses docker/build-push-action to push images to GHCR.
âœ… Helm-Based Kubernetes Deployment â€“ Deploys to the cluster via helm upgrade --install.
âœ… Health Checks & Readiness Probes â€“ Ensures successful deployments before proceeding.
âœ… Auto Rollback on Failure â€“ Implements kubectl rollout undo in case of failed deployments.

### ðŸ“Œ Eliminated Manual Testing Effort
âœ… Automated Integration Tests â€“ Replaced flaky manual testing with GitHub Actions for integration testing.
âœ… k6 Load & Stress Testing â€“ Integrated k6 for performance testing.
âœ… Unit & End-to-End Tests â€“ Ensured code reliability using Jest (backend) and Cypress (frontend).

### ðŸ“Œ Improved Release Confidence & Frequency
âœ… Versioned Deployments â€“ Uses SHA-based image tagging (ghcr.io/myrepo/backend:${{ github.sha }}).
âœ… Incremental Rollout Strategy â€“ Deploys small changes safely without blocking engineers.
âœ… Blue-Green Deployment Strategy â€“ Allows switching traffic seamlessly between versions.

### ðŸ“Œ Added Monitoring and Health Checks
âœ… Added monitoring and health checks which in the deployments automatically triggered.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/atlan-release-optimization.git
cd atlan-release-optimization
```
### Apply the secrets and run it
```bash
helmfile sync
```
### For parallel sync (100k+ lines)
```bash
helmfile sync --concurrency 20
```
## Results

### frontend and backend as been deployed

### Check the status

### Check the namespaces 
![frontend and backend namespaces](assets/Terminal%20helmfile3.png)

### Get the data in the Kubectl
![frontend and backend status](assets/Terminal%20helmfile%20kubectl.png)

## Autoscaling
### Create the autoscaling for backend
```bash 
kubectl apply -f charts/backend/templates/hpa.yaml
```
![create autoscaling](assets/autoscale%20Terminal%201.png)

### Get the Status
```bash 
kubectl get hpa
```
![autoscaling status](assets/autoscaling%20terminal%202.png)

## Testing of Autoscaling
use `hey` an HTTP testing tool
```bash
hey -n 10000 -c 100 http://backend-service.backend-namespace.svc.cluster.local:8080/health
```
or 

use `k6` for testing
In `charts/backend/test/test.js` run the test file
```bash
cd charts/backend/test
k6 run test.js
```
